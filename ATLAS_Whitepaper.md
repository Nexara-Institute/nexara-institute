# Project ATLAS  
## Adaptive, Lightweight, and Autonomous Systems

Flagship Research Program of NEXARA Institute

---

## 1. Vision

Project ATLAS aims to develop a unified multimodal intelligence system capable of continuous adaptation, efficient operation, and autonomous reasoning across domains. The long-term vision is to move beyond static, task-bound AI models toward deployable intelligent systems that evolve with their environments.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Current AI systems are predominantly static, resource-intensive, and narrowly specialized. They struggle with continual learning, real-world deployment constraints, multimodal reasoning, and autonomous adaptation.

Project ATLAS addresses these limitations by investigating a new class of unified systems that are adaptive, lightweight, and autonomous by design.

## 3. Related Work Landscape

This section will map and analyze research in:

- Continual and lifelong learning  
- Efficient and edge AI architectures  
- Multimodal and foundation models  
- Autonomous agents and cognitive systems  

The objective is to identify critical gaps in unification, adaptability, efficiency, and real-world intelligence.

## 4. System Objectives

Project ATLAS targets the development of systems that are:

- Adaptive: capable of continual learning without catastrophic forgetting  
- Lightweight: efficient in parameters, memory, and energy  
- Autonomous: able to reason, decide, and self-improve  
- Multimodal: integrating text, vision, and structured data  
- Deployable: suitable for real-world environments
